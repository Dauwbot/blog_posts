**In this post I bulk up and install Docker!**

I left you with a beautifull Linux distro running on WSL2 last time. I'm sure that you were able to bloat it correctly since?
Well let's see how, why and especially which commands to use to run Docker.

Since Docker developed a GUI I will not mess with the CLI for now, but if it's like GIT, navigating with the CLI should become an objective later on.

Let's [download the Docker installer from the official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) & install it (duh).
